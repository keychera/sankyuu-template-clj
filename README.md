# sankyuu-template-clj

This a clojure project utilizing lwjgl + assimp + opengl to render [glTF models](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) and [MMD models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MikuMikuDance). Status: Incompletea and probably not a lot of model can be rendered yet.

This is not a library, framework, nor a game engine. just a prototype/template project (for now...). Some parts of these project might become its own library later on.

require:

[JDK 25](https://adoptium.net/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)

run (tested only in windows at the moment)

```
clojure -T:lets repl
```
